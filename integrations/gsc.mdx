Welcome to the Site Seedling Google Search Console integration guide! This will help you verify your site with Google Search Console using a meta tag. Let's get your site verified in no time!

<Steps>
    <Step title="Step 1: Sign in to Google Search Console">
        First things first, head over to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console) and sign in with your Google account. If you don't have an account, you'll need to create one. Trust us, it's worth it!
    </Step>
    <Step title="Step 2: Add a Property">
        Once you're signed in, in the top left corner you'll see a drop down for your properties.

        Once you've clicked on the dropdown you'll be presented with a button to "Add propert"

    </Step>
    <Step title="Step 3: Choose URL prefix">
        After adding your site, you'll be taken to the verification methods page. Here, you want to select the **"HTML tag"** option. This method allows you to verify your site by adding a meta tag to your site's <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section.
        
        ![GSC Url Prefix](/images/gsc-url-prefix.png)

        Enter your full website domain name in the box

        <Info>
            You should make sure that you're specifying your website's address including `https`.
        </Info>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Step 4: Verify ownership">
        At this point you should be presented with a screen asking you to verify ownership.

        Under the "Other verification methods" option, expand the "HTML tag" option. It should look something like this:

        ![GSC HTML Tag](/images/gsc-html-tag.png)

        You only require the content part of the tag that they've provided. However, if you press the copy button and paste the full meta tag into Site Seedling, it will pull
        out the information you need.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Step 5: Add the Meta Tag to Site Seedling">
        Now, let's hop over to your Site Seedling dashboard. Once you're logged in, navigate to the section where you can add custom meta tags. 

        <p>Note: This part will be unique to Site Seedling. If youâ€™re not sure where to find it, check out our handy <a href="path/to/guide">Site Seedling Meta Tag Guide</a>.</p>
